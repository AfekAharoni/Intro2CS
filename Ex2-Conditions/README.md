# Exercise 2 - Conditions

**Conditions** is the second exercise I solved as part of Huji's **Introduction to Computer Science** course.  
The main goal of this exercise is to get familiar with **Python 3**, the **Math library**, and to practice basic control structures and functions.

## Exercise Description

This project includes:
1. `calculate_mathematical_expression.py` - Contains two functions to calculate mathematical expressions from a string or direct input.  
2. `largest_and_smallest.py` - Contains functions to determine the largest and smallest numbers among three values, and a tester function.  
3. `quadratic_equation.py` - Contains two functions to solve a quadratic equation either by function call or user input.  
4. `shapes.py` - Contains four functions that calculate the area of different shapes: circle, rectangle, and triangle.  
5. `temperature.py` - Contains a function that checks if at least two out of three temperatures exceed a given threshold.

## How to Run the Code

### 1. `calculate_mathematical_expression.py`  
Calculates mathematical expressions based on user input or provided arguments.

```
python calculate_mathematical_expression.py
```

### 2. `largest_and_smallest.py`  
Finds the largest and smallest values among three numbers and tests the function with multiple cases.

```
python largest_and_smallest.py
```

### 3. `quadratic_equation.py`  
Solves a quadratic equation using coefficients provided by the user.

```
python quadratic_equation.py
```

### 4. `shapes.py`  
Calculates areas of different shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle) based on user input.

```
python shapes.py
```

### 5. `temperature.py`  
Checks if at least two out of three temperatures exceed a threshold value.

```
python temperature.py
```
