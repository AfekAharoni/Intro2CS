# Exercise 4 - Battleship Game

**Battleship Game** is the fourth exercise I solved as part of Huji's **Introduction to Computer Science** course.  
The main goal of this exercise is to get familiar with **Python 3**, the **Math library**, and to implement a full interactive game using loops, functions, and input validation.

## Exercise Description

This project includes:
1. `battleship.py` - The main file that implements the logic of a full Battleship game. It handles the board initialization, ship placement, torpedo actions, and victory conditions.
2. `helper.py` - A supporting file that provides helper functions and constants for the game, such as board display, user input handling, and computer move logic.

In this game:
- The player and the computer each have a board where they place their ships.
- They take turns firing torpedoes at each other's board.
- The first to destroy all opponent ships wins.

## How to Run the Code

Run the game by executing `battleship.py`:

```
python battleship.py
```

---

## Technologies Used
- **Turtle library** (for visualization if expanded)
- **Math library** (`math` module)  
(Although not directly imported in `battleship.py`, the logic relies on mathematical operations and validations.)
