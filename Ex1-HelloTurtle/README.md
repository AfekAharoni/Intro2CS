# Exercise 1 - Hello Turtle

**Hello Turtle** is the first exercise I solved as part of Huji's Introduction to Computer Science course.  
The main goal of this exercise is to get familiar with Python and the Turtle library.

---

## Exercise Description

This project includes:
1. `hello_turtle.py` - A simple program that draws a fleet of ships using the turtle library.
2. `math_print.py` - A program that demonstrates basic calculations using Python's math library.
3. `additional_file.py` - Contains a secret function (you should find out what it prints).

## How to Run the Code

### 1. `hello_turtle.py`  
Draws two ships using Python's turtle graphics.

```
python hello_turtle.py
```

### 2. `math_print.py`  
Performs basic mathematical calculations and prints:
- The golden ratio
- The square of 6
- The hypotenuse of a triangle
- Pi and e values
- The areas of squares with sizes 1x1 to 10x10

```
python math_print.py
```

### 3. `additional_file.py`  
This file has a hidden message.

```
python additional_file.py
```
