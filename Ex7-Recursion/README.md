# Exercise 7 - Recursion and the Tower of Hanoi

**Recursion and the Tower of Hanoi** is the seventh exercise I solved as part of Huji's **Introduction to Computer Science** course.  
The main goal of this exercise is to get familiar with **Python 3**, the **Math library**, and to implement recursive algorithms, including the Tower of Hanoi problem.

## Exercise Description

This project includes:
1. `ex7.py` - Contains various recursive functions including:
   - Multiplication (linear and logarithmic implementations)
   - Even number detection
   - Power-of checks
   - String reversal
   - 2D list comparison
   - Counting the number of 1’s in numbers
   - The Tower of Hanoi algorithm
   - Magic list generation
2. `ex7_helper.py` - Provides helper functions for recursion:
   - Basic math operations (`add`, `subtract_1`, `divide_by_2`, etc.)
   - String manipulation (`append_to_end`)
   - Checks (`is_odd`)
3. `hanoi_game.py` - A graphical user interface (GUI) implementation of the Tower of Hanoi game using **Tkinter** and **Turtle graphics**. This file allows interactive playing and visualization of the algorithm.

## How to Run the Code

### 1. `ex7.py`  
Run individual recursive functions by importing the file into another Python script or using an interactive Python shell.

```
python ex7.py
```

### 2. `hanoi_game.py`  
Launches a GUI that allows interactive playing of the Tower of Hanoi.

```
python hanoi_game.py
```

## Technologies Used
- **Math library** (`math` module)
- **Tkinter** for GUI
- **Turtle graphics** (`turtle` module)
