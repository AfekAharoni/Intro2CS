# Exercise 3 - Loops

**Loops** is the third exercise I solved as part of Huji's **Introduction to Computer Science** course.  
The main goal of this exercise is to get familiar with **Python 3**, the **Math library**, and to practice loops, sequences, and vector operations.

## Exercise Description

This project includes various functions that handle:
1. `input_list()` - Receives numbers from user input and returns a list of floats with their sum appended.
2. `inner_product(vec_1, vec_2)` - Calculates the inner product of two vectors.
3. `sequence_monotonicity(sequence)` - Checks if a sequence is monotonic (increasing/decreasing, strict/non-strict).
4. `filter_list(num_list, operator, number)` - Filters a list according to a given operator and number.
5. `cycle_sublist(lst, start, step)` - Returns elements from a list in steps, cycling through it.
6. `convolve(mat)` - Performs a 3x3 convolution on a matrix.
7. `num_of_orthogonal(vectors)` - Counts the number of orthogonal vector pairs in a list.
