# Introduction to Computer Science - Course Projects

This repository contains the projects and exercises I completed as part of the **Introduction to Computer Science** course  
at the **Hebrew University of Jerusalem**.

The course covers fundamental and advanced programming concepts, using **Python 3** as the main language.  
Throughout the semester, I implemented various algorithms, games, and data processing tools.
